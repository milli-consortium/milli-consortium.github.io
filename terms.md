The Milli Archives Foundation is a non-profit network of archives and archivists dedicated to building, nurturing and sustaining archives across India. It is a Section 8 non-profit company with 12A and 80G tax exemptions under the Income Tax Act of India. Contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@milli.link">hello@milli.link</a> if you need additional details.

#### **Why Milli?**

Archives occupy a critical place in society. India needs a forum for archival standards, preservation and conservation guidelines, open access teaching manuals, digital tools to allow the public to find and share archival material, for multiple archives to exchange knowledge, and for the public to see the archive as part of their daily lives. Milli works with individuals, families, organizations and communities toward building, nurturing and sustaining our collective memory and records in the form of accessible archives. Archives need the attention and care they deserve. Memory matters, and Milli is here to help.

#### **What does Milli do?**

Milli works with individuals, families, organizations and communities toward building, nurturing and sustaining our collective memory and records in the form of accessible archives. It has five areas of work:
* Guidelines and best practices for archives
* Open access tools and resources for archives
* Specialized archival services for tailored needs of archives
* Engaging the public to reimagine archives as part of their everyday lives.
* Training and education in archival methods, from school to professional practice

Milli also facilitates discussions around issues of diversity, archival standards, conservation, physical and digital access, pedagogy, privacy and the development of inclusive description standards. The open access digital platform that Milli is building will allow the public to find, connect, describe and share archival material and stories. It is a unique space not just in India, but anywhere in the world.

#### **Archives Health Tool**

How do you measure and improve the quality of an archive? Milli is developing a free Archives Health Tool for archives across India to self-evaluate along a set of parameters, and work with a benchmarking model that allows them to strengthen their work on an area of their choice. To shape and advise this work, Milli is drawing on the input of over 15 member archives from across India (see https://milli.link/about for more details on the Milli Member Network). 

We are working together on the first draft in the form of a detailed survey to assess each other's archives. Then we aim to work together to refine the tool and take it for a test-drive in person and during visits. Should an archive measure itself based on the structure of its archival material? Perhaps it wishes to be sized by its workflows and policies. Should it look at diversity in its sourcing or uses, or both? How does it balance the rights of various constituents: creator, donor, community, archive, funder, researcher, audience? Is public engagement central to the archives as commons, as third place? How does one place increasing diversity in all measures? The Archives Health Tool is available for every archive, big and small, to assess and improve as they see fit. We hope the public will also nudge archives toward trying the tool out to improve their favourite archive, and get us all closer to archives. 

The project is the first of its kind in India, and a free tool to benefit every memory institution -- whether it is a personal almirah, or a state archive.
