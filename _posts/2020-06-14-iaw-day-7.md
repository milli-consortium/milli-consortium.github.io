The Archive(s) Is a Foreign Country

Terry Cook. Canadian Historical Review, September 2009

â€œâ€¦As archivists appraise records, they are doing nothing less than determining what the future will know about its past: who will have a continuing voice and who will be silenced. Archivists thereby co-create the archive.â€ 

02:31:16	Nirmala Menon:	Is it also important to understand the spectrum of understanding the meaning of Katha and Kavya- that in a story where a telling maybe the same but the discourse is vastly different

02:31:45	Malini Krishnankutty:	The People's Archive of Rural India https://ruralindiaonline.org/

02:32:07	Nirmala Menon:	So much to untangle here- Thanks Nonica! The obsession with the archive-

02:33:56	Dibyadyuti Roy:	Reminded of Carolyn Steedman's "Dust" through Nonica's amazing presentation. Thank you Nonica for promoting the deprivileging of archives.

02:34:29	Malini Krishnankutty:	PARI - the Peoples Archive of Rural India is both a living journal and an archive- perhaps something along the lines of what Nonica suggests?

02:34:59	Padmini Ray Murray:	PARI isn't authored by the people in the archive, though. 

02:35:16	Padmini Ray Murray:	it's ultimately reportage

02:35:46	Malini Krishnankutty:	@PAdmini- right, that's true!

02:36:01	Sritama:	Also a related article, reiterating Padmini's point: Everyday stories: The people's archive and the rural in 'new' India," Studies in South Asian Film & Media 7:1+2, intellect, 2016: 71-88 [pdf] 

02:36:03	Venkat Srinivasan:	@Malini, Padmini, yes: But PARI also has a resources section that gets at the idea of a more decentralized  archive.

02:36:26	Padmini Ray Murray:	some, but I find the use of "people's" quite disingenuous

02:36:33	Titas Bose:	https://m.facebook.com/mappingracialtrauma/

Nonica, would you consider this a step towards disprivileging the archive and looking forward to new archival pedagogies?

02:37:17	Hari Sridhar:	Kush Patel is at Avani Institute of Design: https://avani.edu.in/faculty

02:39:50	Shubha Chaudhuri:	Actually we are at this time involved in a big digitisation project of digitising recording, documents and photographs of Komal Kothari .. we are at the last stage of that now. ie the Archives and Research Centre for Ethnomusicology AIIS as we have worked closely with Komal Kothari and Rupayan since the 1980s.

02:40:27	Aparna Vaidik:	Great News Shubhra!

02:56:45	Shubha Chaudhuri:	wow the Springer article is expensive ! 

02:58:18	Hari Sridhar:	Sritama Chatterjee is at the University of Pittsburgh: https://pitt.academia.edu/SritamaChatterjee

03:00:47	Venkat Srinivasan:	South Asian American Digital Archive: https://www.saada.org/

03:08:38	Shivangi Behera:	I have the Springer article, let me know if anyone needs me to email it to them, will be happy to!

03:09:14	Shubha Chaudhuri:	yes please. shubhac@yahoo.com

03:09:21	Aparna Vaidik:	@Shivangi, you can email it to me. I will have it sent out to everyone

03:09:27	yamaha:	Isn't metadata and using linked data for digital archives in general, down to a discipline now? Sritama made it sound very speculative.

03:09:33	Aparna Vaidik:	Or even directly to whoever wants to read it

03:09:39	Ritwika Misra:	@Shivangi yes please ritwikamisra@gmail.com

03:09:40	Aparna Subramanian:	I have sent the article to you @Shubha Chaudhuri

03:09:51	Shivangi Behera:	@aparna - will do that right away

03:11:17	dhanashree thorat:	Thanks all for this fantastic conversation!

03:11:55	Pratiti:	Do we need to change our academic paradigm, where our training as a historian needs to move from only getting from the archive, but actually building archives.

03:12:03	Titas Bose:	@kush and @sritama: how do you build critical and empathetic student engagement in cocreating archives? I'm asking about tools and spaces of praxis, both digital and physical. Kush has just answered part of this whole talking about his studio. 

03:12:41	Padmini Ray Murray:	@yamaha: yes - though it is true that the disproportionate influence that search engines (Google) have on interface design does perpetuate this approach, though to my mind DH has actually challenged rather than perpetuated this view - the way that we (at Design Beku) built this, very much responds to current thinking in DH about how to present information https://aisforanother.net/pages/viz.html 

03:13:49	Ria Dantewadia:	Hi @Shivangi, yes please. riadantewadia5@gmail.com

03:14:10	SamiaRahim:	@Shivangi, would be grateful if you could send the article to me as well: samiarahim@gmail.com. Thank you!

03:15:58	Venkat Srinivasan:	All: We get back into the discussion in five min: around Noon. Thanks.

03:17:02	Debankita Das:	shivangi, could you send me the article too, dasdebankita131@gmail.com. Thanks

03:18:36	Shivangi Behera:	@debankita - sent.

03:26:58	sangeeta d:	Children's Literature in India:

03:28:10	Kush Patel:	On @Mayaâ€™s question of building or creating versus taking: https://pedagogyofthedigitallyoppressed.hcommons.org/

03:30:04	Padmini Ray Murray:	But the nexus is not only about state but also by dominant caste gatekeepers - and is there not some violence in expecting that everyone wants the archive to exist, where their histories of exploitation is writ large?

03:30:50	Bindu Menon:	Thanks to Milli Archives for a wonderfully curated seminar series. I have not been able to attend all the sessions and so I might be raising a  question that has already been addressed. Something that I notice is an absence of Film archives in these conversations. While film as an  archival material might have come up, I wonder whether the insights of Film and Media Theory on Archiveology ( as in Catherine Russell ) has come up. I think paying attention images themselves, and in its materiality which are what are actually at stake in the growing discourse around media archives will help us address some of the questions regarding temporal and spatial relations in the archives. 



03:31:57	iPhoneNalini Thakur:	Thank You Milli for this excellent program.

03:34:05	Malini Krishnankutty:	Great session! Thanks! just sharing a thought. In India, I guess the situation is so varied, so one end of the spectrum we have the need for dismantling the archive while at the other end, we need to start creating the non-existing archive! In certain professions, even typically (originally) state professions like urban planning or engineering, there is almost no information available on state practices especially post-independence. So there is a great need for building archives especially from the perspective of decolonizing knowledge. 

03:35:45	Venkat Srinivasan:	Maya is referring to this work that Rochelle began: https://publicarchives.wordpress.com/

03:36:44	Venkat Srinivasan:	This reference from a couple of sessions back echoes Padmini's previous point: https://www.nyu.edu/classes/bkg/methods/schwartz.pdf

Archives, Records, and Power: The Making of Modern Memory

Joan Schwartz and Terry Cook. Archival Science, 2002

"It is important, as Verne Harris has noted, not to romanticize the marginalized, or feel elated for saving them from historical oblivion: some do not wish to be â€œrescuedâ€ by mainstream archives and some will feel

their naming by archivists as being â€œmarginalizedâ€ only further marginalizes them."

Verne Harris, â€œSeeing (in) Blindness: South Africa, Archives and Passion for Justiceâ€, draft essay for presentation to New Zealand archivists, August 2001: http://scnc.ukzn.ac.za/doc/LibArchMus/Arch/Harris_V_Freedom_of_information_in_SA_Archives_for_justice.pdf

03:36:46	Nirmala Menon:	I agree with Malini- decolonizing Knowledge Structures requires dismantling at one end and recreate, reimagine, rebuild at the other-

03:37:50	Swati Chawla:	Please put me on the queue.

03:39:32	Nonica Datta:	Malini, the archival paradigm erases and de-archives. Itâ€™s in the interest of the state. The absence of an archive is a deliberate archival practice.

03:40:16	Malini Krishnankutty:	Can anyone throw light on how the various state archives in the different states collect information?  Do they collect information from municipal bodies? Any idea? Are municipal bodies supposed to maintain and create municipal archives? 

03:42:24	Nirmala Menon:	@Malini: It is sausage making from the ward level upwards- I saw that while retrieving information about the Right to Education (RTE) in MP. Each office from the panchayat level maintainsofficial  archival records-

03:42:35	Titas Bose:	Does anyone have any suggestions about public archives related to children's experiences?

03:43:13	Padmini Ray Murray:	@Titas: are you asking about an archive of children's experiences?

03:43:45	Aparna Vaidik:	Could we have more students who are listening in to come in?

03:43:51	Malini Krishnankutty:	@Nonica, thank you! I understand where you are coming from and agree that there is a real need for dismantling the archive. 

03:43:52	Titas Bose:	yes. it can be children's experiences of violence/ education/parenting etc. 

03:44:03	Nirmala Menon:	But it is important to understand the caste/class silent underpinnings that inform these record making practices

03:44:27	Padmini Ray Murray:	@titas: it's tricky because of the ethics around collecting children's testimonies

03:44:41	vishal:	Wow! amazing 60-70 minutes about the pedagogical aspects of Archives. It was very nice, listening to Swati, Nonica, Kush and Sritama. So happy, that people have been working on such ideas. Really Liked- ideas engagement of Archives with Criticality and Creativity in the terms of - Feminist perspective, archival paradigms and praxis, inclusivity, social epistemology (like - how deeply social processes are, and how do we really 'Know'), feelings in digital storytelling, identity, de-privileging, literacy, post-colonial and anti-colonial approaches etc. All of it, certainly will help in deconstructing/unpacking oppressive/liberating roles played by languages, space, time, power, access etc. play in building/changing perceptions and co-creating knowledge. Questions remain- We do not have any dedicated programs/courses for Archival learning/education in India, what can be done? There might be many of us, who may want to work with you guys, how do they approach you?-Thank you Venkat for sharing about 'Archive Week'

03:44:55	Paridhi David Massey:	State Archives collect archives from the Municipal Administration, District Commissioner's Office, the smaller division heads in which information is further divided comes under Public Administration, Block Administration, General Administration, Cantonment papers. 

03:45:06	Rajmani Srivastava:	I can tell why children are finding difficulties in consulting records in National Archives of India

03:45:47	Malini Krishnankutty:	@ Nirmala, thanks but it then appears that there is no systematic record keeping, sadly! 

03:46:12	Malini Krishnankutty:	@ Paridhi, thanks for that!

03:46:42	Nirmala Menon:	@Malini or too systematic and hence silent on aspects that should be foregrounded

03:46:58	Titas Bose:	@padmini: hmm I understand. I was thinking something like The Children's Society records. https://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/

03:47:25	Ritwika Misra:	I do have a question,( as someone who has just begun to work in archives as well as doing my own doctoral research in history) how do you bring  in efforts of individual persons or collectives who have been archiving out of their own volition? they are excellent resources by themselves, but left out of the domain of standards of archiving. eg. there is a blog which archives Soviet books translated in to bengali, and it basically runs on contribution from donors across Bengal. This is just an example. 

03:47:26	Swati Chawla:	And perhaps as Rochelle was sayingâ€” bringing diverse people into the archive, most of whom are not card carrying historiansâ€” is a way of dismantling the archive too.

03:47:41	Paridhi David Massey:	Yeah Malini, the major problem is with very little digitization and lack of staff in the maintenance of these archives. This is further worse in Regional archives, one step below the State archives. 

03:47:46	Nirmala Menon:	Card carrying historians!! Ha Ha!

03:48:10	Swati Chawla:	Difficult to get registered too without the â€œcardâ€â€” university affiliation, letter from adviser etc.

03:48:52	Swati Chawla:	Access also in terms of grants to visit archives.

03:49:05	Rochelle:	True swati, but the fact is that the NAI has had to deal with fashion designers needing to know what kind of costumes to make for jodha akbar

03:49:40	Swati Chawla:	Haha.

03:50:39	Padmini Ray Murray:	@Aparna: I think this what you're flagging up is the huge lacunae in information science: library and info science schools need to step up, not necessarily humanities/social science scholars - however, some of those scholars might very well choose to go into that space (alt ac as it's called in the US) and I do wish that it was better funded and resourced

03:51:32	Padmini Ray Murray:	at least they're striving for authenticity @rochelle :D

03:52:33	Rajmani Srivastava:	There are some technical issues also. we have been inviting students to visit NAI and many students from school came to see records for their summer projects

03:52:57	Rochelle:	Sure Padmini, and the threat of the 'citizen seeking potentially inflammable material' dissolves 

03:53:04	Swati Chawla:	Now with Abhilekh Patal, some of those first/ brief projects can be done from the classroom.

03:53:54	Aparna Subramanian:	@Padmini: I agree that it is the library and information sciences which play a major role here, but the domain being an interdisciplinary one, everyone needs to step up for it. We need experts from different domains, to overcome this lacunae.

03:54:05	Padmini Ray Murray:	the digital, allows for guerilla archiving, just saying...

03:54:07	Nitin Goyal:	yes, in state archives no common person entertain without university, supervisor letter . that's why its need to  go for more n more digital archives,which have lesser barrier regarding entertain commoners

03:55:10	Titas Bose:	@padmini: thank you for saying that :)

03:55:50	Bindu Menon:	Agree with Padmini. Digital archiving opens up possibilities of rethinking collecting, archiving and foraging ..all that can lead to undermining the power of selection and omission that drives state archives ..

03:57:57	Swati Chawla:	@Padmini and @Rochelleâ€” also reminded me of reservations about schooling museum visitors in the colonial period.

04:00:00	Swati Chawla:	Excellent question, Prariti! Thank you!

04:00:03	Nirmala Menon:	Great question!

04:00:58	Nirmala Menon:	Prariti- donâ€™t stop asking these excellent questions! You just made me happy

04:01:17	Bindu Menon:	That's a brilliant question on the aura and power of state archives in the network of archives 

04:02:02	Karan Kumar:	I think its also the question of modes of representation of various historical phenomena in the archives

04:02:42	Karan Kumar:	Which is where maybe archivists and scholars need more reflexivity around their practice

04:03:22	Padmini Ray Murray:	@Prariti, such a great question: you might want to look at digital ethnography as a practice to explore these questions further

04:03:32	Shreeja Sen:	While working with archival sources how can we be better trained to interpret silences and gaps as information? Especially in the case of sensitive histories: histories of trauma and loss. Is it possible to look at the absence of information as information too?

04:06:40	Malini Krishnankutty:	@ Ritwika- thanks for this question.

04:06:56	bhanup:	]=[=\

04:07:02	Swati Chawla:	Shreeja, one way is to read your secondary sources more critically. Some recent histories of the Partition, for example, draw on different kinds of sources (say, Constituent Assembly debates, â€œtraditionalâ€ archives, fiction, oral histories, maps)â€” paying attention to how different sources lend themselves to different narratives. That tells us, for example, how a citizenship file like the one I showed might be silent about experiences that say, a film like Shyam Benegalâ€™s Mammo or an oral history, brings out vividly.

04:07:35	Maya Dodd:	can "repatriate" collections at Archives and Access

04:07:54	Aparna Vaidik:	From Paridhi to Shreeja: HI Shreeja, I think its important to understand who owns the archive and who possibly patronized the maker of the archive. For instance my work is partly based on temple archives, however I am writing a history of the community and the city. Its possible to look at hegemonic institutions and their records and see who are the people they aren't writing about? There are silences in every archives. Temple papers for instance are very exclusive archives. They either don't or speak in a particular way about some communitis, places and group. Its basically what questions you ask the archive you have.

04:08:02	Paridhi David Massey:	This is for Shreeja. 

04:08:32	Paridhi David Massey:	Thanks Aparna! 

04:12:37	Malini Krishnankutty:	To continue with the question that Ritika posed:  Can milli help with setting up archives that are emerging from ongoing research or researchers

04:13:49	Malini Krishnankutty:	some kind of handholding possible?

04:14:11	Nitin Goyal:	apart from  agara university runs a course in archival studies.but there are not much institute run such course

04:14:31	Aparna Vaidik:	@Bindu Menon: Please share some references here that you think will help us think about film archives

04:14:49	Swati Chawla:	May I say something?

04:14:54	Aparna Vaidik:	sure

04:15:14	Venkat Srinivasan:	@Malini: YES! Milli is a set of individuals and communities interested in the nurturing of archives. Still coming up, but here's a permanent space: http://milli.link/ and for collaboration: hello@milli.link

04:15:36	Malini Krishnankutty:	@ Venkat- thanks! will reach out.

04:16:06	Ritwika Misra:	@Malini and @Venkat thank you 

04:16:32	vishal:	Thanks Maya and Venkat. Agree with Venkat and Rochelle, for taking these conversations further.

04:18:26	Ritwika Misra:	Agree @Paridhi 

04:18:29	Aparna Vaidik:	Great Paridhi!

04:18:35	Shreeja Sen:	To add to what Ritika mentioned, there is a library of Little Magazines in Kolkata which is maintained and run by a single individual. The collection goes back to publications from the 1914. How can we perhaps go about offering to volunteer to help catalog and maybe even digits such collections?

04:19:00	Shreeja Sen:	*digitise

04:19:30	Tassadaque Hussain:	interesting session. may I give a perspective on NAI as one who has worked there for many years  

04:19:30	Ritwika Misra:	@shreeja yes it is an excellent repository, some of it has been digitised by the Archives of Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta

04:21:27	Shreeja Sen:	@ritwika thanks for that!

04:23:09	Pratiti:	I have a question about popular artefacts, and how that is not archived. For example, it is much much easier to find scientific writings in form of textbooks and colonial documents in the early 20th century, but is incredibly difficult to find the popular writing, especially the popular writing in Indian languages. How do we understand and archive popular artefacts?

04:27:43	Padmini Ray Murray:	@pratiti: some of this is about how durable the popular object is: for example magazines and other ephemera can be fragile due to the nature of the material: when we undertook the Two Centuries of Indian Print project with the BL, it was a surprise that so much of the material were not "high culture" objects, but rather cookery books, almanacs, erotica, but it was sheer luck (as well as colonial greed) which meant they still existed in such good condition

04:31:27	Venkat Srinivasan:	I don't understand why only a bonafide scholar should have access to what are effectively public documents funded by the public, for the public. There might well be classified documents. But surely that HAS to be a fraction of the material. What is needed is also for the public to push on the archives of the world and make demands.

04:31:38	rohinisharma:	Hello! A bit late to the conversation but I have a question related to community and archives? Could I ask?

04:32:07	Venkat Srinivasan:	National Archives, Abhilkeh Patal: https://www.abhilekh-patal.in/jspui/

04:32:38	Sritama:	a) teaching resources (lesson plans, syllabus and assignments)

04:32:52	Koyna:	some space for pedagogy alongside archival compilation: primary sources etc

04:33:20	Koyna:	^^ sritama exactly!

04:34:01	Sritama:	b) Open-access tools for archiving technologies

04:34:38	Ritwika Misra:	Agree Sritama

04:34:51	Maya Dodd:	list from yesterday: - Is there a conflict to face between standards and diversity? 

- How to actually allow for various vocabularies? And how to enrich existing vocabularies?

- Can protocols work for all: university, government, community, individual, movement, theme?



 Practical q: 

 What to emphasize: diversity, standards, self determination, annotation tools, education, access, preservation, interpretation

How does one export descriptions from <archive> to a common space? 

 How to make something like Milli sustainable: Funding from grants + governments + institutions + public?

04:35:18	Ritwika Misra:	Also will it be possible to make the resources discussed here available?

04:35:33	Aparna Vaidik:	Yes we have compiled them all

04:35:41	Maya Dodd:	yes ritwika at milli.link

04:36:00	Aparna Vaidik:	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ot-6VixXhrWliWrkzFt2PsALWr0LjzA_ZSFvcLZdWpE/edit

04:43:41	Aparna Vaidik:	@Padmini you need to give edit access to everyone to be able to fill in the details

04:45:12	yamaha:	While social sciences, politics and humanities have dominated the archiving discussion, save for the excellent session with P.

04:49:09	Paridhi David Massey:	Thanks for organizing this amazing series of sessions on archives and archival knowledge. Very helpful and interesting aspects. It would be amazing that something like this could be made into a longer series taken up at regular intervals where we can discuss archive related concerns, how to read sources etc. Somehow, universities lack such an approach.
