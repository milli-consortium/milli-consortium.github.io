Moving from archives to the role of museums, our panelists today focused on questions around archival objects, communicating relevance and improving accessibility. Methods of preservation were also discussed, as was the protocol followed by different archivists when processing new material. The second half of the session was an open discussion on oral histories that emphasised on ethical aspects of the practise. Subjectivities of different people, why and how our memories can be selective, as well as the manner in which oral history tends to run against dominant narratives was also central to the conversation.
