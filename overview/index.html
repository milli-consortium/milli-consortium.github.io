      <!-- # Milli Archives Foundation
## A crucible for archives, innovation & education -->

<h3 id="who-are-we">Who are we?</h3>
<p>Milli Archives Foundation is a collective of individuals and communities passionate about nurturing archives in South Asia. It is set up as a Section 8 non-profit company (CIN: U91010KA2023NPL172642), with its registered office at WS No.9, Golden Square, No. 403 Eden Park, 20, Vittal Mallya Road, Bangalore - 560 001. Karnataka. India. It also has approval for 12A and 80G tax exemptions under the Income Tax Act, valid up to March 2026.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-we-do">What do we do?</h3>
<p>Archives enable diverse stories. This aim guides the work of the collective, the purpose, form and content of an archive, and what environments it could nourish in the future. Milli helps individuals and institutions to build and sustain archives. It facilitates discussions among the community around issues of diversity, archival standards, conservation, physical and digital access, pedagogy, privacy and the development of inclusive description standards. And the open access digital platform that Milli intends to build will allow the public to find, connect, describe and share archival material and stories. It is a unique space not just in India, but anywhere in the world.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-millis-objectives">What are Milli’s objectives?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>COLLECT, build, preserve and nurture archives and protect endangered collections</li>
  <li>RESEARCH and develop public tools and resources for archives</li>
  <li>EDUCATE and build capacity, from high school to professional practice</li>
  <li>ENGAGE the public to reimagine the archives as part of their commons</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-does-this-matter">Why does this matter?</h3>
<p>Archives emerge from our collective stories, and they give rise to future intertwined stories. They should be seen as a vibrant core of the physical and digital commons, a place that citizens instinctively reach out to online, or over a weekend visit with their families. But that just doesn’t happen in India. Archives are very difficult to work with due to lack of visibility, unnecessarily strict regulation, and a great deal of apathy from all sides. We need wider awareness, education and engagement, and a strong push toward structured archives along international standards. <strong>Archives need to be examined not just by the fleeting research scholar, but also every member of the public, and also students in secondary or tertiary education, which is perhaps an archives’ biggest untapped potential in India.</strong> We want the community to see – and make – connections between their own lives and the disparate archival records flung across repositories. And through our activities, we intend to foster an environment of archival thinking through education and practice, civic awareness, and broadly, a sense of empathy, seeing a little of us in the other.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-origin-of-milli-and-what-has-it-done-so-far">What is the origin of Milli, and what has it done so far?</h3>
<p>The founding of the Milli Archives Foundation was the result of deliberations within ‘Milli’, a collective of individuals and communities who are passionate about archives. Over the last four years, the above mentioned ideas have gathered steam through collaborations and the free-to-public Milli Sessions, with over 1500 registrants, over 400 active participants from across India and other countries, and 40+ partnering institutions. There really has been no equivalent to this in the past, and it is a unique initiative even at a global scale. All material from the Sessions is publicly accessible: <a href="https://www.milli.link/iaw2020">IAW2020</a> and <a href="https://www.milli.link/iaw2021">IAW2021</a>.</p>

<p>In January 2023, Milli also launched “Archives, Ethics and the Law in India: A Guidebook for Archivists in India”, in collaboration with the Archives at NCBS. The first draft of this open access guidebook can be reviewed at <a href="https://ethics-law.archives.ncbs.res.in">ethics-law.archives.ncbs.res.in</a>. The project is perhaps one of the first of its kind in India. It brings together issues relating to archives, law, ethics, ownership, access, and privacy.</p>

<p>As of 2023, due to its wide reach and unique intent in nurturing archives, it is likely there is hardly any significant archival institution in India that is not aware of Milli. Interactions over the Milli Sessions and with participating institutions and individuals gave a clear need for setting up Milli Archives Foundation as a Section 8 non-profit company that can scale the ideas and bring about a systemic transformation in how we build and engage with archives in India.</p>

<!-- ### How will Milli fulfill its objectives?
Milli is set up as a Section 8 company, with two kinds of activities.

• FREE public good services like open source software tools, resource and best practices guidelines for archiving and conservation in India, standards for archives description, law and ethics guidebooks, curriculum and professional training guides. 

• PAID services to build a community, through archival consultancies, memberships and training. This will be a nominal revenue component (< 15 percent of activity) in the first three years, and it will be spun off as a separate consultancy after three years that will help sustain the public service intent of the Milli Archives Collective. -->

<h3 id="who-is-heading-milli">Who is heading Milli?</h3>
<p>Milli’s founding directors are Venkat Srinivasan (Head, Archives at NCBS), Maya Dodd (educator and professor at FLAME University), Jayaprabha Ravindran (Retired Assistant Director, National Archives of India). Director’s profiles are outlined at the end of this document. We also have a core team of 10 professionals from across the country, and a host of students, working together toward clearly defined activities and objectives.</p>

<p>Some Partner Institutions:</p>

<p>Archives at NCBS, French Institute of Pondicherry, Ashoka Archives, ISI Kolkata, NID Ahmedabad, Keystone Foundation, IISc Archives, IIM Bangalore, Archives and Research Centre for Ethnomusicology – AIIS, QAMRA – NLS Bangalore, OP Jindal Global University Library, WIPRO Archives, IFA Archives, IIT Madras Archives, APU Archives, South Asian Canadian Digital Archive,  have all continued to be part of the initiatives of Milli Archives Foundation.</p>

<h3 id="where-is-this-going">Where is this going?</h3>

<p>Archives emerge from our collective stories, and they give rise to future intertwined stories. Based on our past work, we are confident that the public will see this critical and indispensable role for archives not just in their life stories, but in education, civic awareness and building community. Milli see five kinds of stakeholders: the archivist and the donor who work together to make these resources visible (including the citizen who simply wishes to create an archive of their family at their own residence), the community member who engages with the archive and sees themselves as part of this interconnected history, the researcher – academic, literary and artistic – who sees new avenues of knowledge production with such a nuanced archival network, the educator who sees new ways of teaching their material by delving into historical context, and most importantly, the student at various levels, who will really take the imagination of the archive forward in whichever field they specialize in the future.</p>
