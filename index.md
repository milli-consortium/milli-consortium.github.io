  The Milli Archives Foundation is a non-profit network of archives and archivists dedicated to building, nurturing and sustaining archives across India.

  Archival records shed light on the context and process of our lives, from an old family photo album to a bundle of letters with your mentor, from a recording of a community elder’s memories to a company’s board minutes or a social movement’s banner. An accessible archive drawing on our collective memory enables a diversity of stories for the future. Milli works with individuals, families, organizations and communities toward building, nurturing and sustaining our collective memory and records in the form of accessible archives. Archives need the attention and care they deserve. Memory matters, and Milli is here to help.

  <br><br>

  Everything Milli does is for nurturing archives in the country. It is a non-profit foundation, and relies on public support to make its work possible. Please do consider supporting this movement, and help build, nurture and sustain our collective memory through accessible archives.
