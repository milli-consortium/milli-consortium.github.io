#### OVERVIEW
Galleries, libraries, archives and museums are often bunched together as the GLAM sector, a grouping of cultural heritage institutions that gather, preserve and provide access to our collective knowledge and heritage across disciplines. They have separate roles, but increasingly, they all do a little bit of the other. Museums, of course, have long had public-facing exhibition galleries. Now, archives and libraries do too. Libraries have special archival collections. Museums and galleries have libraries. And galleries (in many parts of India at least) are often called museums, since the public often associates with museums only through their public-facing gallery avatar.

So, we wanted to experiment with a simple provocation: in 2026, what is a gallery, library, archive, or museum like in different parts of the world? Through four international presentations, plus plenty of time allocated to discussion, we would like to better understand what these entities are today. What are their core characteristics and what of them appears still to align with some sense of their ‘definitions’? And what are intriguing ways in which they are being extended and reimagined? How can they be strengthened without diluting what is essential about an archive, a museum, or a library as of now?
