* **6:00 PM: Public Lecture - Walking in and (rarely) Out of the Archives Tridip Suhrud**

**Overview:**
The lecture draws upon Tridip Suhrud’s experience of being in the archives as a scholar and as an archivist who has worked in three archives and created two digital repositories. The approach and the intent of a scholar are necessarily different from that of an archivist. The lecture would reflect upon the intertwining of these two distinct practices.

**Bio:**
Tridip Suhrud is a scholar, writer and translator who works on the intellectual and cultural history of modern Gujarat and the Gandhian intellectual tradition. As the director and chief editor of the Sabarmati Ashram Preservation and Memorial Trust (2012-2017), he was responsible for creating the world’s largest digital archive on Gandhi—the Gandhi Heritage Portal. His books include the critical edition of Hind Swaraj, Narayan Desai’s four-volume biography of Gandhi, My Life is My Message, and the four-volume epic Gujarati novel, Sarasvatichandra. His recent works include a critical edition of Gandhi’s autobiography My Experiments with Truth in two languages, Gujarati and English, and The Diary of Manu Gandhi (1943-44) and a compilation The Power of Non-Violent Resistance. He is working on an eight-volume compendium of testimonies of indigo cultivators of Champaran. He is professor and Provost of CEPT University, and Director of Lalbhai Dalpatbhai Institute of Indology, Ahmedabad. (Bio excerpted from: https://gandhi2020ucla.weebly.com/tridip-suhrud.html)
