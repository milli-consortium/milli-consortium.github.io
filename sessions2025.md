Calling the creative community in Ahmedabad for an inspiring evening of connection at the annual Milli Sessions, hosted this year by CEPT Archives. All are welcome to the Archives Mixer! Designers, architects, artists, come by and bring your friends to discuss the rich world of archives, exchange ideas, and spark new collaborations. Let’s mingle over shared stories, and a shared love for art and design. Depending on the gathering, we can explore how to develop archives out of various design, art and architecture history projects. We can’t wait to see you there!

* **6:00 PM: Public Lecture - Walking in and (rarely) Out of the Archives**
  
  **Tridip Suhrud**

**Overview:**
The lecture draws upon Tridip Suhrud’s experience of being in the archives as a scholar and as an archivist who has worked in three archives and created two digital repositories. The approach and the intent of a scholar are necessarily different from that of an archivist. The lecture would reflect upon the intertwining of these two distinct practices.

**Bio:**
Tridip Suhrud is a Professor and Provost of CEPT University, Ahmedabad. He is also a Director of Lalbhai Dalpatbhai Institute of Indology, Ahmedabad and serves as Chairman of the Governing Council of MICA. He is a renowned scholar in the field of political science and cultural history. His recent works include the critical editions of M K Gandhi’s Hind Swaraj and the Autobiography, a two-volume project on editing and translating the diary of Manu Gandhi (one part published), has translated into English the canonical Gujarati novel, Sarasvatichandra, and is currently working on a possible nine volume project, Thumb Printed (two volumes published) on the testimonies of indigo cultivators of Champaran.
