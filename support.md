#### **Why Milli?**

Archives occupy a critical place in society. India needs a forum for archival standards, preservation and conservation guidelines, open access teaching manuals, digital tools to allow the public to find and share archival material, for multiple archives to exchange knowledge, and for the public to see the archive as part of their daily lives. Milli works with individuals, families, organizations and communities toward building, nurturing and sustaining our collective memory and records in the form of accessible archives. Archives need the attention and care they deserve. Memory matters, and Milli is here to help.

#### **What does Milli do?**

Milli works with individuals, families, organizations and communities toward building, nurturing and sustaining our collective memory and records in the form of accessible archives. It has five areas of work:
* Guidelines and best practices for archives
* Open access tools and resources for archives
* Specialized archival services for tailored needs of archives
* Engaging the public to reimagine archives as part of their everyday lives.
* Training and education in archival methods, from school to professional practice

Milli also facilitates discussions around issues of diversity, archival standards, conservation, physical and digital access, pedagogy, privacy and the development of inclusive description standards. The open access digital platform that Milli is building will allow the public to find, connect, describe and share archival material and stories. It is a unique space not just in India, but anywhere in the world.
